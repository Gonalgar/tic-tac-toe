# Tic-Tac-Toe Project

This is a **Tic-Tac-Toe** game built as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) JavaScript curriculum. The project focuses on using JavaScript modules, factory functions, and DOM manipulation to create a functional and interactive game.

## Features

- A fully playable Tic-Tac-Toe game:
- Displays the winner or a tie at the end of the game.
- Dynamic and interactive game board built with DOM manipulation.
- Reset button to restart the game and play again.
- Responsive design for usability on desktop and mobile devices.
